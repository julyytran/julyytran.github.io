<p> Racoon dogs have been adorably taking the internet by storm. Aside from cuteness, what else makes this animal so interesting?
<ul>
  <li>Racoon dogs, also known as "Tanuki," are actually neither dogs nor racoons! They are members of the canid family, which includes dogs, wolves, and foxes.</li>
  <li>They are the only member of the canid family that hibernates in winter!
  <li>Tanuki are native to East Asia. In Japanese folklore, they are shape-shifters associated with magic and luck!</li>
  <li>The Super Mario item "tanooki suit" is based off the racoon dog and grants Mario/Luigi cool powers!</li>
</ul></p>

<p> Sadly, life is not all fun and games for the racoon dog. They are often inhumanely bred and killed for their pelts, which are sold as "faux fur." </p>
