<p>I like racoons because they look super cute with their little bandit masks.</p>

<p> I also like dogs because they are super cute, always happy, and just want to love you.</p>

<p> Now, if you're like me, you're already feeling pretty good looking at racoons and dogs. But what if I were to tell you that there is such an animal as a RACOON DOG?!</p>

<p> Racoon dogs are real and awesome. But what makes a racoon dog such a COOL ANIMAL?? </p>

<ul>
  <li>Racoon dogs, also known as "Tanuki," are actually neither dogs nor racoons! They are members of the canid family, which includes dogs, wolves, and foxes.</li>
  <li>They are the only member of the canid family that hibernates in winter!
  <li>Tanuki are native to East Asia. In Japanese folklore, they are shape-shifters associated with magic and luck!</li>
  <li>The Super Mario item "tanooki suit" is based off the racoon dog and grants Mario/Luigi cool powers!</li>

</ul>

<p> Racoon dogs are a COOL ANIMAL but you know what's NOT COOL? They are inhumanely bred and killed for their fur, which is sold as "faux fur"</p>
